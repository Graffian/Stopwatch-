As usual copy link of my repository and clone it and run wherever you want

I used the setInterval to create a stopwatch, i also tried to go with milliseconds , but it couldn't be precise to begin with no matter what i tried my stopwatch didn't have precision when i tried to snuck in milliseconds

Went through solutions on YouTube and i tried , and i found out that the setInterval function for millisecond works best for 10 milli seconds upto 100 then a second gets updated 

so i have edited my code accordingly you can also reset now with the reset button it sets everything to 00:00:00:00
