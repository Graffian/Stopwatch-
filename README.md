I used the setInterval to create a stopwatch, i also tried to go with milliseconds , but it couldn't be precise to begin with no matter what i tried my stopwatch didn't have precision when i tried to snuck in milliseconds
so i removed the milliseconds for proper functioning of the code , it doesn't have a delay or anything
Ps:- after you click on start button it starts after 1 sec
